## Problem

Music theory teachers often rely on **visualizations** to teach and assess analytical concepts.

We have standard methods of visually representing

- [x] pitch (Western musical notation)
- [x] rhythm (Western or TUBS notation)
- [x] form (charts, diagrams, and tables)

---

- Many authors represent instrumentation and timbre with layer graphs (Butler 2006; Dolan 2013) [add image]
- Such graphs can be made with Excel or Powerpoint, but it's laborious


---

## Solution?

Auralayer: a web app designed for ease of use

### Basic steps to use

1. Go to website (no app installation!)
2. User imports a recording (not a score!)
3. User adds layers
4. User splits layers into segments

---

## Features

- Mobile friendly
- Get audio from YouTube or local file
- Save and share via data file or QR code; download image in future version
- Assign layer names/colors
- Add text to layer segments
- Show segment presence (loudness, etc.?) through opacity or height
  - cresc./decresc. through gradients or slopes
- Play back audio as cursor advances through graph

---

## Example assignments

- Graph functional layers after Moore (2012) of "get him back!" by Olivia Rodrigo
- Graph rhythmic motives for "Come On, Feel the Illinoise" by Sufjan Stevens
- In "Launch Pad Zone" from _Sonic the Hedgehog 3_:
  - Graph instrumentation
  - Graph channel usage
  - Compare the two graphs; observe how instrumentation is split across sound chip channels
- Processual (non-hierarchical) form analyses
