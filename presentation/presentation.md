## Problem

Music theory teachers often rely on **visualizations** to teach and assess analytical concepts.
  
We have standard methods of visually representing 
  
*  [x] pitch (Western musical notation)
*  [x] rhythm (Western or TUBS notation)
*  [x] form (charts, diagrams, and tables)

---

* Many authors represent instrumentation and timbre with layer graphs (Butler 2006; Dolan 2013)
* Such graphs can be made with Excel or Powerpoint, but it's laborious

---

## Solution?

Auralayer: a web app designed for ease of use

### Basic steps to use

1. Go to website (no app installation!)
2. User imports a recording (not a score!)
3. User adds layers 
4. User splits layers into segments 

---

## Features

* Mobile friendly
* Get audio from Youtube or local file
* Save and share via data file, image, or QR code
* Assign layer names/colors
* Show layer presence (loudness, etc.?) through opacity or layer height
  * cresc./decresc. through gradients or slopes
* Play back audio as cursor advances through graph

## Demo Analyses

## Example assignments

* Graph functional layers after Moore (2012) of "get him back!" by Olivia Rodrigo
* Graph rhythmic motives for "Come On, Feel the Illinoise" by Sufjan Stevens
* In "Launch Pad Zone" from *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*: 
  * Graph instrumentation
  * Graph channel usage 
  * Compare the two graphs; observe how instrumentation is split across sound chip channels
